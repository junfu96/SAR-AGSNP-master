# SAR-AGSNP

## Introduction
This repository provides the open-source implementation of **SAR-AGSNP**,  
a structure–activity relationship guided graph neural network model implemented using **PyTorch**.

The associated paper is currently **under review**.  
This repository is released to promote **reproducibility and further research**.

---

## Environment
- Programming Language: **Python**
- Deep Learning Framework: **PyTorch**
- Experiment & Visualization: **Jupyter Notebook**

It is recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., conda) for dependency management.
